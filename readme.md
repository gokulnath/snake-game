# Snake game

A basic snake game using vanilla JavaScript. It uses setInterval to move the snake in a canvas.

## Notes

- Movement of the snake was hard to implement at first. I got help in that, I now know that I can just create a new block and disappear the last one.

- After figuring out movement of snake, the rest was kinda easy. Just needed to put my time and do the work.
